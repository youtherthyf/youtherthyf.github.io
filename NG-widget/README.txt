Dear youtherthyf,

I apologize for dumping this on you all so sudden. But, I'm grateful that you
expressed the desire to continue maintaining the widget I have made for your
webring.

This ZIP file contains the following:

            assets: The folder containing assets used for the `minimal` design,
                    and for any potential future designs.
       backgrounds: The folder containing the default background, and for any
                    potential future backgrounds.
example-usage.html: Showcases how to use the script, with no design, with the
                    minimal design, and the minimal design with a custom
                    background.
        webring.js: The source code and script used by each member for the
                    webring. Documented with comments.

Thank you, youtherthyf.
